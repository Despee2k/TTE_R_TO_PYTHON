What I want you to do is convert the given R code into Python code. Use the dataset data_censored.csv, I gave you a image snippet on what the data looks like, it is a file in the same directory as the code. Do it similar to the R code where they did it in a series of steps. Don't give me one big chunk of python code. Separate them similar to how analysis is done in Jupyter notebook. Also have a diagram similar to the diagram I have given you as a final output to check if you were able to successfully change the R code to Python code.

You've converted R code for Target Trial Emulation (TTE) into Python and need to verify the outputs. Please compare:
1. Survival Estimates – Do Kaplan-Meier curves, hazard ratios, and risk differences match?
2. Causal Effects – Are inverse probability weights, g-formula estimates, and treatment effects consistent?
3. Model Outputs – Do regression coefficients, confidence intervals, and p-values align?
4. Sensitivity Analyses – Are bootstrapped estimates or subgroup results similar?

P.S. 
I tried to do it myself but I didn't get the same results. NEXT TIME I'LL DO IT SUCCESSFULLY TRUST.
